# IACV_Projective_Synchronization

The goal of synchronization is to estimate the values of some unknown states related to a network, given some measurements, typically corrupted by noise, between pairs of nodes.

## Image Mosaicing

Synchronization can be used to solve the image mosaicing problem, whose goal, given a set of images from which pairs of relative homographies are computed, is to align the images into a single mosaic.

## Projective Synchronization

This project extends some techniques used to solve the image mosaicing problem to the projective synchronization problem, in which the goal is to align different projective frames into a single global projective frame.
